# Encouraging contributions

The Readme file represents the first interaction most users are going to have with your repository. Let's make sure it is a good one!

### More detail 

What do you need to know when you first encounter a repository? We've been immersed in our own context for so long it can be hard to imagine what it is like when coming across it with little or no context.

Let's structure the readme to give context.
* Purpose - what is the goal of this project, why did we create it
* Overview - at a high level how does it work? Are there depedencies that we assume are in place
* Getting started - using the simplest possible example let's get people up and running
* Help - what to do if things go wrong?

## Step 1: Creating a welcoming first iteration

Let's setup our readme to make a good first impression!
